<b>PANAS test:</b><br>
The results of my personal PANAS test, are: Positive affect: 30 Negative affect: 27 The PANAS test, or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, measures, as the extended name suggests, the susceptibility of positive and negative affect toward personality traits, i.e., moods and emotions. More specifically regarding the scale, ‘positive affect’ refers to the individual’s tendency to experience positive emotions, a more positive manner of interaction and engagement with others and with personal obstacles and challenges. On the other hand, ‘negative affect’ scales traits of a more negative or unpleasurable nature, perspectives of negative inclination towards things such as connections and surroundings. For each dimension of the PANAS scale, both positive and negative, the resulting score falls between 10 and 50. The scale of score indicates one’s general susceptibility of negative and positive affect, whereby in terms of positive affect, a score of <25 is considered low positive affect, 26-35 is moderate and >36 is high. As for negative affect, a score of <10 is considered low negative affect, 11-20 moderate, and >21 is high.

    <h1> Ideal Jobs Analysis </h1>  
    
    <h2> IT Manager </h2>
    <p> Summary <br>
The Information Technology (IT) Manager role is a key executive-level role in the IT field. The IT Manager is responsible for managing one or more teams of IT professionals. The IT Manager may oversee one or more aspects of IT within the organization including software development, infrastructure, or systems administration functions. Depending on the size of the organization, the IT Manager will report to a higher-level IT Manager or directly to the Chief Information Officer (CIO).  </P>
  <p> <i>Comparison of Requirements, Experience and Renumeration</i>  </p>
  <p> Referring to Table [X], the IT Manager role will require technical knowledge and expertise to reach this executive level, though it is a role focused on project and people management. Transitioning to this new focus in IT initially may be challenging for technical specialists, especially in terms of negotiation and conflict resolution.  </p>
  <p> In terms of qualifications and experience, the IT Manager role requires at a minimum a qualification equivalent to a Bachelor of IT, Business or a related subject and the highest level of prior experience. Applicants for an IT Manager role would benefit from a Masters’ degree. The prior experience requirement of 5 years is reflective of the need for a successful IT Manager to be skilled both technically and interpersonally, having had opportunities to develop these skills in previous roles.  </p> 
  <p> The renumeration and benefits given to an IT Manager may also be the highest of the roles compared, though this also depends on the size of the organization.  </p>
  <p><i> Perspective on the Role – Valentin Parail  </i> </p>
  <p> We believe Valentin would be great for this role if he would complete the Bachelor of IT and continue with learning and training and getting better at negotiating with fellow team members. He still has a lot to learn about information technology as well and would benefit from spending more time with professionals working in the industry.  </p>
  
  <h2> Visual Simulator Database Developer  </h2>
  
  <p> Summary  </p>
  <p> The Visual Simulator Database Developer role is a specialist technical role which focuses on developing, maintaining and/or improving the visual database software which is used in a simulation device. Devices can include simulators used to train pilots and ship captains as well as ADF forces and Emergency Services personnel. It is important that the visual database is kept updated to reflect the real-world environment as closely as possible. The role may work individually or as part of a team of other software developers and/or software engineers, and report to a senior leader within an organization.     </p>
  <p><i> Comparison of Requirements, Experience and Renumeration </i>  </p> 
  <p> Referring to Table [X], this role is primarily a technical role requiring software development and systems administration skills, though it also requires some level of interpersonal and communication skill to work well alongside others, clarify task requirements and present outcomes of work done.   </p>
  <p> A successful application for this role will require a Bachelor of IT, Business or other course with a focus on programming. Like the IT Manager, a Masters’ degree in these fields is also likely to be highly regarded.  </p>  
  <p> The renumeration and benefits associated with this role is on par with the other technical roles and is reasonable for a technical specialist in the current market.  </p>  
  <p><i> Perspective on the Role – Christopher Anderson  </i></p>  
  <p> We believe that Christopher would be well suited for this role as he seems very keen on introduction to information technology, he is very knowledgeable in terms of the industry and keeping up with the latest trends.   </p>
  
  <h2> Digital Forensics Senior Consultant  </h2>
  
  <p> Summary  </p>
  <p> A Senior Consultant role in the Digital Forensics field is a highly-experienced, client-focused and independent technical professional. The role is at the intersection of the IT and legal fields, as its primary focus is to gather digital evidence to support legal requests and claims.  </p>
  <p><i> Comparison of Requirements, Experience and Renumeration  </i></p>
  <p> As the role is focused on gathering and preserving digital evidence to support legal requests, the role requires an exceptional degree of technical skill across a wide variety of software and IT infrastructure. However, the role also requires exceptional interpersonal skills as the Senior Consultant will work directly with clients.  </p>
  <p> A successful applicant for this role may have a Certificate, Diploma or Bachelor degree in IT or a related field, especially Computer Science. Higher qualifications may also be highly regarded.  </p>
  <p> The Digital Forensics Senior Consultant role is similar to the IT Manager as the role also involves strategic planning, relationship management, project management and communication skills. However, the level of ongoing technical work directly required of the Senior Consultant is much higher than the IT Manager, who will be supported by their direct reports. It is likely that the Senior Consultant will be involved in a smaller number of projects than the IT Manager in a given timeframe due to the level of effort required directly from the Senior Consultant.  </p>
  <p> Given this comparison, it is likely that the Senior Consultant will be given similar renumeration and benefits to the IT Manager.   </p> 
  <p><i> Perspective on the Role – Andrew McKenna  </i>  </p>
  <p> Due to some of the positions no longer been on Seek we did change one of the positions. Andrew McKenna decided to change his position to something a little more exciting and more involved. He thought it would require quite a bit more education and knowledge to walk down this path and make good use of his other education. This role appears to have a lot more requirements and does seem to be a lot more involved. We believe Andrew would will suit for this role and he would be a great addition to all teams with his willingness to always help and get everything done.  </p>
  
  <h2> Cyber Security Analyst  </h2> 
  <p> summary </p>
  <p> The Cyber Security Analyst is a technical role which works as part of a team to detect and respond to cyber-security threats affecting an organization. The nature and size of the organization involved will determine the specific role requirements and qualifications required for the role (comparing a security threat termed ‘cyber-warfare’ with a network attack affecting a small Internet Service Provider).  </p>
  <p><i> Comparison of Requirements, Experience and Renumeration  </i></p>
  <p> The Cyber Security Analyst role also has a technical focus, though is broader than the other roles as the focus can cover direct interaction with software, hardware and systems administration functions to understand and resolve security threats and their consequences.  </p>
  <p> This role requires a Bachelor of IT or Business, with further education such as a Masters’ helping to increase the knowledge and skill of the Analyst. Success in the role is also supported by any relevant previous experience, especially through interaction with specialist software and systems. Knowledge of how systems are designed is one the highest requirements for a Cyber Security Analyst as a comprehensive knowledge of a system will be required to protect it. A higher level of communication skill will also be required for this role as the security threat itself is likely to be a highly technical problem, and not all stakeholders involved will have a technical background.  </p>  
  <p> The Cyber Security Analyst can expect renumeration similar to the other roles, though this may be higher in accordance with the skills and experience they need for the particular role.  </p> 
  <p><i> Perspective on the Role – Oliver Sloane  </i></p>  
  <p> Oliver has sadly been very busy in the background during this period and assessing him has been difficult. However, he has come through in the end and shown great potential to be a valuable team member. We believe that he would be suited for the Cyber security analyst role as he has the willingness to go through all hardships and still perform to the best of his ability.  </p>
  <h2> Amazon Web Services (AWS) DevOps Specialist  </h2>
  <p> Summary </p>
  <p> The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Development Operations (DevOps) Specialist is a technical role that works primarily with cloud-based products and services developed by Amazon Inc. These products can be used to manage and work with large amounts of data, and perform highly technical functions including deploying machine learning algorithms. The AWS DevOps specialist will work within a team of IT professionals and engineers to use these products effectively within an organization, and report to a senior leader.  </p>
  <p><i> Comparison of Requirements, Experience and Renumeration</i></p>
  <p> The role is focused solely on technical functions within an organization, which will be planned and delivered by a team inclusive of this role. The Specialist will not need strong interpersonal skills with a focus on leadership, though will need to work effectively within a team.  </p>
  <p> The AWS DevOps Specialist role requires a similar level of qualification to the Digital Simulator Database Developer and potentially the Cyber Security Analyst roles (Bachelor in IT or Business, Masters’ highly regarded), though specific experience with AWS products and services is likely to be required. An individual may need to undertake further learning outside their previous education to meet this requirement, unless training is provided or had been undertaken in a previous role.  </p>
  <p> The renumeration and benefits associated with this role is on par with the other technical roles and is reasonable for a technical specialist in the current market.  </p> 
  <p><i> Perspective on the Role – Marc Winbank</i></p>  
  <p> Marc has always been a hard worker and therefore this role would suit him well. He has always worked well in teams and has always been able to keep calm under a situation of great pressure. We believe he would success in the role AWS DevOps Specialist if he would continue his IT education.  </p>
  
  <h2> General Assessment of All Roles  </h2>
  <p> Considering each position’s level of education and experience required, the role requiring the most professional development is the IT Manager role. In decreasing order, this is followed by the Digital Forensics Senior Consultant, Cyber Security Analyst and lastly the AWS DevOps Specialist and Visual Simulator Database Developer roles.  </p>
  <p> Beyond their existing experience and education, for Valentin and Andrew to progress to their chosen roles, they will need to develop a balanced technical and interpersonal skillset, while Oliver and Marc will need to focus on developing specialist technical skills and knowledge in Cyber Security and AWS products respectively.  </p>
  <p> Based on the assessment in Table [X], each person will be able to look forward to similar renumeration, though Valentin and Andrew can expect further benefits reflecting the greater responsibility they will take on in their desired roles.  </p>
  <p> To prepare the limited assessment in Table [X], we combined our results from Assignment 1 with a brief period of internet research. Ultimately, we have found that while comparing pay is straightforward, we cannot clearly rank these positions as the specific requirements of each can vary as required by the organisation.  </p>

<h1>IT Technologies</h1>
<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity is one of the most important emerging fields in today’s world. As more and more of our lives and society goes online ensuring that it cannot be compromised is vitally important. Cybersecurity refers to the practice of securing critical information and systems from digital attacks (What is Cybersecurity? 2020). To first understand cybersecurity, it is important to understand how serious a problem digital attacks are and why a digital attacker would want to compromise a system or data. Digital attacks can come in many forms and be conducted by many different actors. One really cool tool to see the scope of digital attacks around the world are attack maps like the one found <a href = "https://cybermap.kaspersky.com" target="_blank">here</a>. Digital attacks are increasingly focussed on trying to steal data, either about customers of a business, company secrets, or intelligence gathering by companies or states. Digital attacks also have the potential have significant effects on our day to day lives, the most significant recent example of this is the Ransomware attack on the NHS in the UK. According to Cybersecurity some threats are indeed becoming less common due to improved security technology and better digital hygiene, targeted attacks have remained constant, and in fact, as the cybersecurity field makes advances, attackers also get more sophisticated (Blau, Burt, Groysberg and Yampolskiy, 2019). To better understand this field, this article will examine one current cybersecurity issue, one emerging trend, and one technology that will emerge and play a big role in the future.</p>

<p>One of the areas of cybersecurity that has been identified as having the most need for improvement is the human element of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity quotes the statistic that 90% of data breaches and security threats are a result of phishing attacks. Phishing is something almost everyone has dealt with in their personal lives, random emails pretending to be a person or a company that try to trick you into opening a link, which then lets an attacker into the network or computer. The growing uptake of password managers and two factor authentication are examples of increasing trends towards better cybersecurity literacy amongst the population. Another of the recommendations of Cybersecurity for securing businesses is to foster communication between employees and the IT security team and to provide better education for employees about cybersecurity practices. This trend will effect employees in IT and cybersecurity fields, and will mean that they will need to become more integrated with the other employees of a business, and that their role may become more about educating employees and helping everyone at a company become aware of how to protect the data and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Another of the recent trends in the cybersecurity field is trying to integrate security into programs and systems at the very start of the project Kumar and Goyal describe this approach in their article Modelling Continuous Security. Traditionally, cybersecurity and development were somewhat separated. Developers would design a system or a program or an app, then cybersecurity experts would try and make it secure with a limited time frame, right before the project went to market. The recent trends in the cybersecurity field have largely focussed on trying to integrate security into programs and systems according to the principles of shifting security left, Security-by-Design, and Security-as-Code, and Adaptive Security. These three principles combined means that code is written in such a way as to limit its vulnerability to attacks from as early as possible, and continually checked for vulnerabilities (Kumar and Goyal, 2020). This trend will effect employees and businesses involved in software development, it means that the jobs of the future will require ever more knowledge and experience in implementing high standards of privacy and security throughout the development process.</p>

<p>Another trend in the field is towards the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in cybersecurity. Implications of Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity gives many examples of uses for AI and ML in perpetrating increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, including the use of AI to fool authentication systems with synthetic fingerprints or voices, to write increasingly more effective targeted phishing attacks, and to carry out automatic attacks without the need for the attacker to micromanage (Johnson and Grumbling, 2019). To match these new capabilities, cybersecurity defences will need to utilise AI and ML too. Fortunately, cybersecurity defences are already utilising AI and ML to harden their defences against attackers. These methods are also outlined in Implications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Cybersecurity, at the cutting edge of the technology is the use of ML to identify suspicious assess of information, eliminating the need for cybersecurity specialists to trawl through enormous amounts of data, and meaning that access can be more tightly compartmentalised. The book also describes how a company called INKY uses a combination of AI and ML to identify phishing attacks by examining the content of a phishing email more closely than a human is capable of with the end goal of making phishing defences so effective that email phishing attacks are rendered impossible (Johnson and Grumbling, 2019). The use of AI and ML in cybersecurity is fairly limited at the moment, but the potential uses are both incredibly vast, and incredibly powerful, as the technology grows, expect to see these technologies become much more widespread as important cybersecurity tools. This trend will largely affect cybersecurity professionals and IT workers, they will become more reliant on automated systems for security. The maintenance and efficient utilisation of AI and ML may become a significant role in the future. This trend will also have a significant impact on all users of IT technology, but potentially in such a way as users aren’t even aware of its utilisation.</p>

<p>In my personal life, and the life of my family and friends, cybersecurity is of incredible importance, even if it’s not always immediately obvious. It is due to the pervasion of cybersecurity measures that we can securely bank on our phones and computers, that we can log in to our private WiFi network, and that we can use password managers every day. Cybersecurity is an incredibly important field to all users of technology, and as that is something that I find many people take for granted. With emerging trends in the field, I hope that cybersecurity will become something more people are aware of and take an active interest and engagement in. I believe that with the cultural trend of greater technological literacy, and the trend in the cybersecurity field towards more people becoming aware of and actively involved in the security field, even if it’s a peripheral part of their job, that all users of technology, all companies, all education institutions, and all nations will become more secure and better able to manage the risks of our increasing dependence on technology. Personally, I believe that to pursue a career in cybersecurity I will need to be open to learning an increasingly wide variety of skills, especially in the fields of AI and ML, and being able to effectively communicate the importance of cybersecurity and the many ways in which it can be implemented, both at the human level, and the software level.</p>

<h2>Small Computing Devices</h2>

<p>Small computing devices like the models offered by Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Makey Makey have been around for a pretty long time now, with the first model of single board computer being released in 2003 (Johnston et al., 2018). The most common kind of small computing device is a single board computer. A single board computer is a fully functioning computer, with a processor, memory, inputs and outputs, and all other necessary hardware, built on a single circuit board. What makes these devices special is that compared to larger computers and smaller computers like controller boards they have a good balance of performance with cost. SBCs are almost endlessly flexible, and cheap enough to be affordable to everyone. For this reason, one of the main applications of SBCs is as an educational tool for teaching programming and computer science. SBCs like the Raspberry Pi models in particular are a cheap and relatively straightforward gateway into using Linux based operating systems, and due to their flexibility and low cost, the range of applications for SBCs is almost endless. Johnston and their fellow authors of Commodity Single Board Computers and Their Applications argue that the SBC has become a core building block for projects due to the factors mentioned above, and their low power consumption (Johnston et al., 2018).</p>

<p>Another widespread application of SBCs is their Prescence in Internet of Things devices and small-scale computing projects. The Internet of Things with Arduino Cookbook published all the way back in 2016, contains a host of applications for an Arduino board in home automation from automatically turning on a coffee machine to making a cloud connected door lock (Schwartz, 2016), and the website Nevon Projects, found <a href="https://nevonprojects.com/iot-projects/#startscroll" target="_blank">here</a>, contains dozens of IoT applications for SBCs, but the applications for SBCs in the IoT are endless. As the SBCs become more powerful, smaller and cheaper, the number of possible applications is only going to grow. The flexibility and cost efficiency also make SBCs a powerful tool in industry. Kanagachidambaresan describes in his book published in 2021, how a IoT connected Raspberry Pi could be used to control fruit ripening during the shipping process, making the distribution of fruit around the world significantly more efficient (Kanagachidambaresan, 2021). The author also describes how SBCs can be combined with 3D printing technology to create, prototype, and mass produce devices easily and in a way that is cheap and accessible to the developing world (Kanagachidambaresan, 2021). The Internet of Things is a particularly interesting trend, as more and more devices become connected to the internet and to each other, it is important that the ability to create them does not become monopolised.</p>

<p>Heading into the future, SBCs will become more powerful, cheaper, and more widely used. One application of SBCs that is predicted to become more widely used is the SBC cluster. This involves a combination of SBCs to create a cluster that can cheaply and effectively replicate some of the features of larger scale traditional data centres. This change is required due to the predicted demands on data processing centres, and the growing need to make them more distributed, more efficient, and better for the environment. This change is being led by proponents of Cloudlet computing, edge computing, and fog computing. The replacement of traditional data centres with clusters of SBCs has been shown to produce cheaper, more carbon friendly, and comparable performance (Fernández-Cerero et al., 2019). The uptake of SBC clusters to replace some of the work and usages of traditional data centres especially in education, in places where the data centre will potentially be lost or destroyed, or in the application of emerging fog and edge computing, the technology that makes the IoT possible (Johnston et al., 2018). In Commodity Single Board Computers and their Applications the authors describe how SBC clusters will become a core feature in the education of IT, Edge computing and the IoT, as cluster computing will overtake the traditional stand alone machine. The authors also expect to see many more designs for SBCs, with a larger variety of features, and more powerful hardware. The authors also expect that clusters of SBCs will become integrated in increasingly more important infrastructure (Johnston et al., 2018). From this list of predictions and the trends in the field. It is reasonable to expect that SBCs will play a major role in helping the rest of the developing world and remote communities come online. The low initial and ongoing cost of SBCs serve to lower the barrier to entry significantly to the field of programming and computing in general. The ongoing development of SBCs will definitely change the way that people think about computers and computing, but rather than take away jobs in IT, this trend will make them significantly more available to everyone. By significantly lowering the barrier to entry in terms of cost, almost anyone who is interested can buy their first computer for “as little as a few weeks pocket money” (Johnston et al., 2018). The uptake of SBCs has the potential help people all over the world to become more technologically literate and better connected to the internet and to each other. </p>

<p>In my research I have come to understand SBCs and small computing devices as a microcosm of the world of computers. They best exemplify the trends of people becoming involved with computers and computer-based projects at a younger age, and of computers becoming smaller, cheaper, and more powerful, and the trend of greater computer integration into daily life especially as part of the Internet of Things. I was a bit of a late adopter into programming, a tool as simple as a single board computer could have made a significant difference to the path I took to university and to my skills and confidence in programming. As part of my research, I have looked at dozens of applications of SBCs and I am really fascinated by the variety of applications, beyond anything I could imagine. I will definitely be getting on the bandwagon and buying a SBC to try out, so my friends and family can definitely look forwards to that. I think that as I get older and have children of my own that they will benefit significantly from early education and widespread experience with SBCs. As generations are brought up with more and earlier exposure to technology and computers, I expect to see a change in how our culture handles technology, beyond the expected comfort using it, I think that people will have more of a general knowledge about the parts of their devices, how to get the most out of them and a better understanding of cybersecurity. I think that this is a really interesting field with such incredible potential to change the world, and we are only beginning to see the range of uses that this technology makes possible.</p>

<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

<p>Of the emerging technologies, like cloud computing, single board computers, and blockchains, autonomous vehicles are the easiest for a layperson to grasp, and to not just grasp that it is coming, but the effects of its emergence too. Autonomous cars and trucks are going to significantly change the way people and goods travel, and it is no longer a matter of if this technology will come, but in how few years. Already, cars and trucks are becoming more and more automated, new generations of cars have parking assist, are capable of monitoring positioning in the lane and even complete autopilot. However, the way forward is not completely clear, issues such as consumer confidence and the ability of the power grid to handle the load mean that autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to factors that improved technology may not be able to fix despite the clear benefits of changing.</p>

<p>The adoption of autonomous vehicles will come in two main flavours, the industrial or logistics field, and the passenger field. One of the most convincing arguments for the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles is the potential climate and environmental benefits. In Autonomous Vehicles Technologies, Regulations, and Social Impacts the authors argue that in order for an increasingly more urban population to be sustained, the key is not to build more roads and transport infrastructure, but to more efficiently use what we already have. They argue that with significantly less traffic being required, and the use of clean energy in autonomous vehicles, the climate benefits will obviously be significant.
Another of the obvious benefits to automated vehicles, both commercial and for public use, is the safety advantages. As the authors of Autonomous Vehicles Technologies, Regulations, and Social Impact assert, the European Union reports that over 90% of road accidents are the result of human error, the authors also argue that the inability of human drivers to account for traffic and environmental factors beyond their line of sight leads to inefficient use of fuel operation of the vehicle (Dimitrakopoulos, Tsakanikas and Panagiotopoulos, 2021). Whether uptake of autonomous vehicles is focused initially on the industrial or passenger fields, automated vehicles are safer and more efficient that human drivers and as technology improves, with better engines, improved sensors, and communication between vehicles that gap is only going to get more significant.
</p>

<p>One of the impacts most associated with a rise in autonomous vehicles is the effect on jobs. With fully automated freight and passenger travel, truck drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and all the industries built around those jobs would be significantly affected. How truck drivers in particular will be affected is controversial. While it is true that fully automated vehicles would not need a driver, in his chapter of Are We There Yet?: The Myths and Realities of Autonomous Vehicles Sriraj argues that instead of completely replacing human drivers, autonomous trucks could help address driver shortages by making the work easier and more appealing to younger drivers (Pagano et al., 2020). Until trucks are fully automated, truck driving will remain a job, but after, it’s hard to imagine that it will still exist. Another factor in how autonomous vehicles will impact jobs is how greater ability to travel will allow greater development of regional areas. A study in China found that using automated vehicles increased the accessibility of jobs in regional areas which in the long term, would create more jobs than would be lost by the automation of driving jobs (Zhong et al., 2020). Given that the pattern of development in Australia is more similar to China than it is to the US, both China and Australia are well known to have highly developed coastal regions and a relatively undeveloped regional centre, it is very likely that the same dynamics will play out here, as the recent COVID pandemic has shown, regional jobs in Australia are too dependent on foreign backpackers for labour, with fast and efficient travel possible to regional areas, perhaps those vacant jobs can be filled by unemployed people in larger cities.</p>

<p>One challenge in the adoption of autonomous vehicles is the ability of the current power grid to handle the load of charging all these vehicles. To address the problem of strain on the power grid, the authors of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles in Smart Cities propose that cities invest in creating a distributed network of microgrids, which would allow cities to scale and be modified according to trends in urbanisation and uptake of autonomous vehicles, and which do not have a single point of failure that could take down the entire grid (Mouftah, Erol-Kantarci and Sorour, 2020). Another challenge is the proven ability of hackers to take over partially autonomous vehicles. Before the public and industry will think of adopting autonomous vehicles, the cybersecurity will need to be really solid. Not necessarily because hackers will hack every single one of them, but because it contributes to the fear around adopting these technologies. Taeihagh and Lim have a really good breakdown of the cybersecurity threats to autonomous vehicles. Their list includes spoofing GPS, confusing sensors, stealing data, and controlling brakes and engines (Taeihagh and Lim, 2018). Until the public is satisfied that autonomous vehicles are safe, and industry believes that they are profitable, autonomous vehicles will remain part of the future, not the present.</p>

<p>The rise of autonomous vehicles will be a truly incredible technological and environmental achievement, but it is also fascinating to think about how it will affect the adopting society. This is something that really interested me during my research into the field of autonomous vehicles, with more efficient cars on the streets, there will also be less cars, less pollution, better air quality in cities, less infrastructure needed to support all the cars we use now. How will cities and society adapt to these changes? Will there be resistance from people who simply enjoy driving? I think Grush and Niles are correct when they argue that humans have proven ourselves to be largely unable to consume in a way that is environmentally responsible unless the eco-friendly alternative is better than what we would choose otherwise (Grush and Niles, 2018). I went into the research on this topic already believing that autonomous vehicles would cost people their jobs and have a severe negative effect on the economy, my research has helped me understand that, if anything, autonomous vehicles can be significantly more beneficial to the economy than than failing to adopt them. Given what I have come to understand about autonomous vehicles in my research, I think they will have really a really profound impact on our society and culture. I believe that learning to drive and owning your own car is a powerful social norm, and that so much of how our cities and suburbs are designed around how easily they can be accessed by car. Making the switch to autonomous vehicles will change not just the way we travel, I think it will significantly change where we travel to, how we think of ourselves and our relationship to cars, and how our cities and the spaces we work and live are designed.</p>

 <h2> Robots  </h2>
 <p>
Robots today are everywhere around the globe, in different shapes and sizes, being designed and programmed to do sophisticated tasks or even simple chores. So what is a robot, a robot is a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer. Another understanding of what robots are is, a machine resemblance of a human being action, such as grabbing an item with your hand and lifting your arm. Thus, these machine also being autonomous to do these tasks without the need of a driver as such.
</p>

<p> The origin of robots started in 1954, created by a man called George Devol, who developed the Unimate. The Unimate was the first robot made to be used in the industrial industry, with its hydraulic arm it could manipulate its arm to perform repetitive tasks. It was put to work to automate metalworking and the welding processes for car manufacturers. </P>

<p> The state-of-the-art robots that we see today, have developed so far beyond George Devol’s Unimate. We have industrial robots that produce thousand of items a minute. Coca-Cola produces 500 billion bottles of coke a year, that is 200,000 bottles a minute with the help of autonomous robots. Surgeons around the world have access to ground-breaking technology due to the advancement of robotics, to save the lives of their patients. To precisely be able to identify the health risk in a patient, to then resolve the issue in a more accurate and timely manner compared to without robots to help them. Thus, the state of robots has increased drastically, with no slowing of their pioneering capacity. </p>

<p> For the foreseeable future of robotics is incredibly broad with the possibilities that can occur. For example, currently with covid 19 infecting the world, this may be the push for companies to implement more robots in hospitals to battle this crisis. With machines they cannot get sick, they can’t travel from what they have been programmed to do, they don’t go out in public and spread this disease. They can be isolated to the red zone void wards. The capabilities of the robots can range from, taking a patient’s temperature, to emptying a bed pan and even administrating lifesaving medication.  </p>

<p> Another foreseeable advancement for robotics is in the home, a lot of people are being kept inside due to this pandemic, not being able to have any human interactions that is not over a digital screen. So, a possible development for robots is an assistant home bot. That could help a different range of people. From the elderly to infants, performing tasks to help with day to day lives. With the elderly, they may need a carer to look after them, but with the pandemic there could be a chance that the health care worker could pass along the virus to that elderly person. A robot could deliver the same care needed, making the bed, preparing medication, helping them in the bathroom and countless other actions it could carry out.  </p>

<p> It could also just be a support for people who are by themselves. Robots are meant to mimic the motor functions of humans, like Unimate, which is just a hydraulic arm. The possibility for the future of having social interactions with a robot. This could help millions of people with mental illness who are stuck inside, having the social interaction with a robot could do wonders for them. To make them not feel so alone in this world crisis. </p>

<p> With the development of robots impacting our everyday lives, certain industries are being taken over by robots due to their productiveness. With the implementation of robots in areas of Aerospace, automotive, beverage, computers, e-commerce and countless more, have boosted these industries to knew lengths, but what about the local workforce. 1.7 million jobs lost to robots since 2000 ( a report by ABC news ). With is set that 20 million manufacturing jobs will be lost by 2030. With the lower-income workers set to loose their jobs to robots. There are benefits to the development of robots, buts also the ugly side to them. </p>

<p> Another good thing about the growth of robots is, it allows us to connect to friends and family a lot easier. With automated services keeping us up to date with our friends lives, which gives us the feeling like we just saw them yesterday. Services like messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook allow us to simply press a button and we can see their face on a screen. This allows families to stay connected and be a part of special moments, like birthdays and anniversaries, with even those upsetting moments like funerals. That progress with technology has allowed families to stay together, to grow up with dad and mum in their lives. With the robotics industry making it easier to stay connected every day. </p>

<p> The advancement of robotics has been amazing, but also very devastating for different people. From the first industrial robot Unimate, coming into the automotive industry, starting the pioneering journey which has progressed so far, which has allowed us to produce tones of product to sell, to boost the income of many countries around the world. To advancement in hospitals, being able to help the sick and elderly. With households increasing productivity in a day, and being able to stay connected to loved ones and friends. With the development of robotics still making everyday easier for humans and the progression not slowing down any time soon. </p>

<h2> Project Idea </h2>

<p>Our project idea is for a questionnaire program that runs in the Python shell to calculate the user’s actual risk of being a victim of a crime. To almost everyone, criminology students included, crime statistics are hard to understand and practically meaningless to apply to anyone. This program idea would change that by asking the user questions, and using those responses, interpreting the actual risk as a percentage using crime statistics stored as variables. These variables will be stored in SQL database with the intention of keeping the quiz simplistic and convenient for users to complete. This would mean that each user would get an accurate picture of their risk of  crime based on data like the demographic they are in, the suburb they live in, whether they have been a victim of a crime recently, etc. We also intend for this program to, also based on user responses, print a list of the crimes that the user will most likely be a victim of and give suggestions to reduce their risk of crime. It could also return links to explanations of criminology theory if the user is interested. If we categorise our answers by linking a crime type to each letter of response, i.e. question “a” will be linked to theft and if the user answers mostly with “a” then links relevant to theft avoidance will be provided. </p>

<p> Our motivation to create this program comes from our team member Andrew’s experience studying fear of crime in criminology, and from his experience in moving house. Fear of crime is essentially the public’s perception of their likelihood of being a victim of a crime. Both conventional media like newspapers and news programs, and social media have been shown to increase fear of crime far beyond the actual risk. One of the first things Andrew did when moving house was to look at crime statistics in the area he was going to move to. “I know I’m not alone in doing this as my girlfriend’s mum also looked at them when she was considering moving too”. You hear it all the time when someone is moving; “Is that a good area” so when this assignment came along, Andrew thought of doing something like this straight away.  </p>

<p> Our program, which would run from the python shell, would ask the user questions. User answers would trigger an if condition, which would then determine which variable would be assigned to their risk percentage. Each answer that they give would either increase or decrease their risk. At the end of the questionnaire the program would print their risk as a percentage, along with a list of the top three crimes that they are most likely to be a victim of, and, based on this list, suggestions on how to reduce their risk.  </p>

<p> A quiz of say 10 questions with answers provided adding to a points-based system, that converts the users score to a criminal susceptibility percentage i.e.   </P>
  <ol>
    <li> each question will have 4 possible answers   </li>
    <li> each answer will have a points total assigned to it  </li>
    <li> those who choose answer “a” will have 0.25 added to their percentage total  </li>
    <li> those who choose answer “b” will have 0.5 added to their percentage total  </li>
    <li> answer “c” could have 0.75 added and so on  </li>
    <li> these values can be varied to cater for the type of question and possible answers as “none of the above” or “all of the above” responses may be relevant and these could score 0 and 1 respectively  </li>
  </ol>
<p> Further question examples could be if a user enters that they are male, 18-25, and live in Armadale in Western Australia, the program will look at what crime statistics are applicable to males of that age range, in that area. It would then print the three crimes that the user is most likely to be a victim of and display them, most likely violent crimes like assault. It would then give a suggestion on how to minimise the risk of assault, for example, ‘avoid bars and places where alcohol is served, especially on days where there is a UFC or Boxing match being played there’. In terms of tools and technologies that are required to create the project, it is simple. Initially requiring only, the python shell and a text editor to run and program, and GitHub to collaborate with other team members. It could be created as an app with a Graphical User Interface while retaining the same questionnaire style. We will use a standard python GUI such as Tkinter, as this will enable us to display text for our questions, clickable buttons for our answers and enable us to receive user info to update our sql database via “user input entry widgets”. Once we have a bank of questions as part of Assignment 3 we will be able to create the tables and populate the GUI. <br>

We hope this program can make crime statistics accessible to everyone who is interested without the extra work of trawling through everything published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We hope the project would also make the statistics relevant to the user, instead of just being abstract. A personalised estimate of a person’s risk of crime would help with the phenomenon of fear of crime in the community. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we hope that the suggestions given by the program can do some good and prevent crimes.</p>

<h2> IT Work  </h2>

<p><b> For this requirement, Group 16 arranged an interview with IT professional, Peter Franca. Peter is the IT manager of Corescan Pty Ltd (<a>https://corescan.com.au/</a>), a global mining technology service company based in Perth, Western Australia. The interview was performed in the Corescan office, and a transcript/summary is below: </b> </p>

<p style="color:red;"> 1. Could you please tell us about your IT work at Corescan. What exactly do you do?  </p>

<p> I am an IT Manager. My main role is to make sure the IT team are supporting the infrastructure and IT services of Corescan and its branches. Some of my current duties are:  </p>

<ul>
<li> Working with the executive team to develop the IT strategy, vision and roadmap.  </li>
<li> Assess, recommend, and integrate new IT technology trends and solutions.  </li>
<li> Ensuring IT technologies used are effective, leading edge and recommend changes.  </li>
<li> Ensuring the company's IT assets are effective, secure, and commercially viable.  </li>
<li> Managing IT budgets, time frames and team KPIs.  </li>
<li> Ensuring all IT practices adhere to regulatory standards.  </li>
</ul>

<p style="color:red;">2. Please tell us about the industry you work in. </p>
<p> The IT industry is a fast-paced industry. New technologies emerge very day which post a challenge for the workers. The challenge is to keep up to date with the new emerging techs. IT is driving the world to a better and more connected world which helps not just IT but other industries as well. For instance, the internet of things is now booming, and this can help us to have safer roads with automated cars. This is just a tiny example of the large possibility that lays ahead of us.   </p>
<p style="color:red;"> 3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?  </p>
<p> Right now I have a mix of duties. I am managing the IT team of Corescan as well as supporting the global network that connected all our branches together. More specifically, some of my duties are:  </p>
<ul>
<li> Linux administration   </li>
<li> Monitor IT system health and respond to faults  </li>
 </ul>

<p style="color:red;"> The IT team have an interesting set of graphic dashboards on display to monitor the health of IT hardware and infrastructure. Corescan have some very remote projects which are in 24-hour operation – a core part of the business is building on the acquisition of this data in the field, so, if equipment has issues, this can have significant flow-on effects. What tools or platforms do you use to summarise and monitor critical health information?  </p>
<p> The main tool that we use to monitor is called Zabbix. Zabbix can monitor any device connected to the network, even a cell phone. Zabbix agent is installed to connect the device to the server and with that communication, the agent can gather and share the metrics we would like to monitor. We set up different dashboards depending on department requirements. For example, when processing images, we can display CPU usage. Image processing batches are staged, so a quick graphical display can give the geologist or processing technician information required to know when the server is ready to receive the next image batch. </p>

<ul>
  <li> Documentation of equipment, licensing, tasks, and procedures</li>

  <li> Archival and recovery of data using archive system.  </li>
</ul>

<p style="color:red;"> Data security is obviously very important to Corescan’s clients and to the company, and the datasets sent from the field are quite large. What is the current method of archiving once data arrives to the HQ?  </p>

<p>  Right now, we have 4 tape drives and once data is uploaded to the server, we back-up the data onto two separate magnetic tape drives. One copy is the ‘offsite’ copy, and the other is the ‘onsite’ copy. The purpose of the offsite copy is to ensure if there is some type of disaster at the office, all data is recoverable. </p>

<p style="color:red;"> Is there a reason for using tape rather than another method? Reliability? Cost?  </p>

<p> The reliability is an important factor and additionally, lifespan of tape drives is ~10 years. Despite tape being a relatively old tech, it is still widely used for data back-up in many companies.  </p>

<ul>
  <li> Cisco Administration  </li>
  <li> Mail Administration  </li>
  <li> AWS Administration   </li>
  <li> Windows server administration  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color:red;">4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. </p>

<p> My day-to-day interaction will vary a lot. Of course, my main interaction will be with the IT team as we need to have daily discussions about what we need to do and how we can do it. Once a week I have a meeting with our managing director to update him about clients, new requests and the best way to achieve the results we are after.   </p>

<p style="color:red;"> 5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.  </p>

<p> I personally use LinkedIn to interact with other professionals from the same industry. This is a great way to keep connected. Often, I engage in online discussion to help others or to express my thoughts about new technologies.   </p>

<p style="color:red;"> Are there any industry subscriptions or associations that you are a part of, or can recommend for someone interested in an IT career?  </p>

<p> Currently I’m part of the Australian Computer Society (ACS). ACS is a major group for IT professionals in Australia and it monitors emerging trends and technologies in the industry. It sends out all members a summary of what is going on, and I have found the information interesting and useful to be a part of.  </p>

<p style="color:red;"> In the conversation, Peter mentioned that he did a diploma in Australia. Peter is from Brazil and studied his bachelor’s degree there, so I asked about the differences in the IT industry between Brazil and Australia.  </p>

<p> Different IT technologies may be used in different regions, however the IT industry is very global. It is mostly the companies that vary tech usage. In Brazil we used a lot of open-source operating systems, such as Linux. Here in Australia, it seems many companies choose to pay and subscribe to software. In Australia, Linux is not used as heavily as in Brazil.  </p>

<p style="color:red;"> 6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?  </p>

<p> Whenever I need to interact with clients it is because something is not working properly or there is a new tech that the client is requiring. So, when interacting with clients I am mainly focused on how to resolve the problem he/she has as quick as possible or how to implement a new tech available that will support his business in a better way. I don’t have any contact with the investors.  </p>

<p style="color:red;"> 7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.  </p>

<p> Without a doubt is client support. As am managing a global company and we have client all around the globe managing them is hard. I need to think about time zones and the best time to connect with them. This is a challenge because sometimes I need to start very early and finish late in order to keep the client happy.  </p>

<p style="color:red;"> 8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?  </p>

<p> Because IT is a fast-paced world, keeping up with all the new tech emerging daily is the most challenging aspect of my line of work.  </p>

<p style="color:red;"> Do you see any particular emerging tech that might “revolutionise” your current scope of work with Corescan?  </p>

<p> Yes, definitely. Around 6 months ago I undertook a network certification with Cisco. While studying I came across a technology called SD-WAN. This means I could interconnect routers and switches as one unified network. Right now, Corescan have branches/facilities in many locations across the world and we currently use VPNs to interconnect. VPNs are reliable but old tech and the time-consuming element here is that our server network is hosted and centralised in Australia. So, for example, if someone is working in Vancouver, they are performing work on the Australian server, connected through a VPN. With SD-WAN, we can set-up servers in a centralised location and the amount of configuration work is a lot less. For any new configuration changes applied, the SD-WAN system pushes the standardised changes across our network. Currently, any configuration change requires me to access each router individually and mirror changes applied from our main router in Australia. It is very time-consuming work, however the SD-Wan tech will require me to configure only one router. </p>

<p style="color:red;"> 9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?  </p>

<p> The last project I was involved, was to implement a global telephone system which would make possible for clients to reach any of our branches using a single telephone number.   </p>

<p> To accomplish this the IT team used 3CX VoIP system together with AWS to connect the branches. The project consisted in creating an instance in each country we have a presence in by using AWS and buying numbers for each country using Twilio.  </p>

<p> Connecting the Twilio SIP number back to the instance, creating outbound/inbound rules, extensions, groups, queue rings, IVR.   </p>

<p> This is a good example on how technologies can connect us to anyone in the world.  </p>
